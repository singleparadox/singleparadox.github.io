        Day 2, we were briefed on which department we should work with. I was supposed to go the OPD (Office of Planning and Development) but the staff there told me to wait at MAPA and go back at 1pm. At 1pm, we received a message from OPD that they will meet us instead at Monday. We were assigned to MAPA as a result. They discussed about what system they want to use and gave us data to use. After a few hours, it was decided that I would not be assigned to OPD as they were too busy to handle an OJT student. I was assigned here at MAPA instead. I also completed the design of the system that I am going to make which is the Yearbook Bibliographic Entry System.</p>
