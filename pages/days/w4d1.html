	Busy day. We were given a lot of paperwork to encode into an excel file. Four brown envelopes were given and each had papers that were almost 2 inches thick. It was a tiring day. To work faster and efficiently, we have decided to divide the work, I would be given two envelops and Mark (Classmate) would also be given two. Due to laziness and frustration, I created a PHP script that would triple our efficiency. It helped us drastically as it made us work faster.
