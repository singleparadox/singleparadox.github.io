		Day 8, The Grand Alumni Homecoming day, we went there early (7am) as we needed to prepare. We all helped all day and was rewarded with a wide array of food. I mostly helped with the Alumni registration. I also helped on the needed errands for the event. I helped hand out the souvenirs (Keychains). Not much happened as I sat at the registration booth for a long time to help for the Alumni Registration. After the event, we helped clean up and went back to the office to prepare to go home.
