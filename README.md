A blogging website that I created for the upcoming OJT program. I intend to use this to record my data as it is a requirement for the program. Since, GitHub sites can only use static sites, I manually coded each page.

Third Party frameworks used: 
(All these frameworks, including the image at the homepage, does not belong to me. All rights goes to their respective owner)
- Simplex (https://bootswatch.com/simplex/)
- JQuery (https://jquery.com/)
